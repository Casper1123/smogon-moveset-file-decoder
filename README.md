# Smogon Moveset file decoder
Oh do I damn hope I named it correctly, as it's not exactly 'encoded' of any kind just formatted annoyingly.\
Takes apart files findable in https://www.smogon.com/stats/yyyy-mm/moveset/ into usable dictionaries in your projects.
# Does still contain one unknown datapiece
I genuinely could not find what it is used for.\
Here is an example:\
> | Cloyster 85.624 (95.07Â±2.36)           |\
> |	 (39.8% KOed / 55.3% switched out)|

I have no idea what this ```85.624``` means. If you know please let me know so I can rename it all across the board.\
It is included in the dicts.
# Here is some documentation because you will need it.
