# Smogon Moveset file decoder
Oh do I damn hope I named it correctly, as it's not exactly 'encoded' of any kind just formatted annoyingly.\
Takes apart files findable in https://www.smogon.com/stats/yyyy-mm/ into usable dictionaries in your projects.
See the wiki below for all compatible filestructures.

# Here is some documentation because you will probably need it.
