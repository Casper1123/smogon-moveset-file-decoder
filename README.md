# Smogon  file decoder
Oh do I damn hope I named it correctly, as it's not exactly 'encoded' of any kind just formatted annoyingly.\
Takes apart files findable in https://www.smogon.com/stats/yyyy-mm/ into usable dictionaries in your projects.
See the wiki below for all compatible filestructures.

# Why this over the /chaos/ section on the stats website?
I think my information sorting is way better. Is that a little cocky? maybe. I did *just* find out it exists, while I'm basically halfway through the project
but I still think this option is a good alternative, if not better.

# Here is some documentation because you will probably need it.
